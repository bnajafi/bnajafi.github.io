I'm an anthropologist currently located in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I'm interested in digital anthropology, computational methods,
and human-technology-animal-environment relations. When I'm not thinking or writing, I can probably be found 
walking my dog Luki, playing with my little daughter Aya, bouldering, or reading a book by my favorite authors [David Mitchell][david], 
[Dan Simmons][dan], or [Tonke Dragt][tonke].

I recently submitted my PhD thesis on social memory in Germany at the [Anthropology Department][utrechtanthro] 
at Utrecht University.
Since May 2015, I'm also working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Chemical Youth][chem] project at the 
[Anthropology Department][uvaanthro] of the University of Amsterdam with [Prof. Anita Hardon][anita].
In October 2016, I'll be joining the research group of [Prof. Julia Verne][verne] at the [Department of Geography][geobonn]
of the University of Bonn.
