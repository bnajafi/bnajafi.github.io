I am currently transitioning between various anthropological research projects.

In May, I submitted my PhD thesis on social memory in Germany at the [Anthropology Department][utrechtanthro] at Utrecht University,
which I'm planning to defend on the 28th of October 2016. For my PhD, I conducted fieldwork with young adults in Cologne, in two
settings of Holocaust education: at the museum [NS-DOK][nsdok], and at an evening school.

Since May 2015, I'm also working as a postdoctoral researcher at the [Chemical Youth][chem] project at the 
[Anthropology Department][uvaanthro] of the University of Amsterdam with [Prof. Anita Hardon][anita]. My work there explores
the possibilities of integrating digital and computational methods
with ethnography, and is inspired by cooperations with the [DMI Amsterdam][dmi], the [Utrecht Data School][uds], 
the [Density Design Lab Milan][density], and [Calibro Design Lab][calibro].

In October 2016, I'll be joining the research group of [Prof. Julia Verne][verne] at the [Department of Geography][geobonn]
of the University of Bonn, which focuses on translocality, digitality, and human-environment relations in the 
Western Indian Ocean. I'll be conducting a research project on the illegal trade with endangered marine fauna
and the role of the internet, combining ethnographic research and digital methods.
