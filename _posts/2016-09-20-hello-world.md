Apart from the rather obligatory academic lecture, I LOVE reading novels! I read so many novels,
my husband gets upset when I start a new one, because he knows he won't be able to talk to
me during the next evenings. If it's a good novel, I simply can't do anything else
anymore.
I especially enjoy sci-fi and fantasy, and a genre I'm sure has a name, but I don't know it, 
which are stories that start in a realistic way, and then get a twist and turn surreal. 
As both an anthropologist and a feminist, I also look at novels from an analytical point of
view, and enjoy those most which are thoroughly researched, thought through, and
challenge gender stereotypes.

In this blog, I'll share the novels I read and review them briefly. This is as much for myself
as for others. I want to keep track of what I read and what I thought about it, and I also
enjoy recommending the novels I loved most to friends.

If you get something out of it, even better :)
